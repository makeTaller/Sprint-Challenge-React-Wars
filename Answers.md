1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.
React is a library that solves the problem of the increasing amount of dynamic content in modern websites. It allows us to update only the nodes on the DOM that have changed and not the whole DOM every time the state of data changes. 

2. What does it mean to think in react?
To think in react means to plan and think ahead of time about the flow of the data and how it will be used by which components. 

3. Describe state.
State is the state of the data in a website, in React state is used to hold a specific value and it is how react knows when to update the virtual DOM.

4. Describe props.
Props are state that have been passed down from a parent element to a child element.

5. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?
Side effects are just events that we want to happen and the useEffect hook takes a second parameter that tells it when you would like the effect to be run.
